This is the CamelDemo project.

This project contains beginner level samples for different patterns and functionality within the Camel framework. As this is a maven project feel free to clone and run it within your IDE of choice. Tu run it simple run the maven command: camel:run -DskipTests if you want to run it without tests.

If you run it inside Intellij simple run it with Maven command.

Finally put the appropiate test file in its test folder and observe the results.

If you spot any errors let me know. Thanks.
